## General info
This browser app was designed for use by student support staff at the university where I work. Learning specialists often need to help probation students with goal-setting to improve their grades, but the calculation to help students identify their target GPA was error-prone. Staff often struggled to remember the steps if they didn't make the calculations very often; a simple tool was needed which could run in the browser and which would eliminate mistakes.

The single-page app collects 4 data points:

* Student's prior attempted credit hours (from their transcript)
* Student's total 'quality points' (from their transcript)
* Credit hours being taken in the current semester
* Overall target GPA (e.g. if they are on Probation, they may need a particular GPA)

With this data, the app produces a GPA that the student needs to achieve in the current semester to reach their overall target GPA. It also allows for grade replacement of D and F grades.

Although this was made with a particular advising context in mind, there are many schools that calculate GPA in a similar manner, so small changes to the Javascript code should allow for it to be used by other schools.

It should be noted that I designed this at the same time that I was taking a Web Development at Oregon State, and I was interested in further developing my skills at manipulating DOM elements in response to user activity.
